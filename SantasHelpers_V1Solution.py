""" This solution uses Joyce Noah-Vanhoucke's naive solution as a template, but adds some different approaches.
 This is my first time programming in python so this is also to help me learn it.

  Algorithm in pseudo-code:

  1. Each day load in all of the toys that will arrive that day, or have arrived before.
  2. Split the toys into toys that can be finished today, and toys that cannot possibly be finished today.
        Put the ones that cannot be finished today into a "todo" list for later.
  3. Optimize it so the the most number of elves have the most full day possible.

  this pattern should work well for all toys that take less than one full day (40 elf-hours (or 2400 elf-minutes)) for a 4.0 rated elf.

  There's about 2 million toys that take more than 2400 elf-minutes. About 8 million toys that take less than 2400 elf-minutes.
